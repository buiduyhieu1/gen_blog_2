<p>In our last instalment,</p>
<p> we discussed Qt's QListWidget class, which allows the user to make simple single-column list boxes. For more advanced list controls, however, a more fl</p>
<p>exible widget is required; for that reason, Qt supplies the QListView widget, which allows more varied items to be created. It is a pure presentation widget, which displays information pro</p>
<p>vided by a data model. This separates the logic of the data being presented from the widget that does the presentation; there are multiple widgets that can display data from the same model structures.</p>
<p>There are some specialized types of model already created for you. For example, the QStandardItemModel provides limited capabilities that are somewhat greater than those</p>
<p> we saw in last installment's discussion of the QListWidget; in addition to text and icons, it provides drag-and-drop capabilities, checkable items, and other features. Custom behavior can be implemented by inheriting from the QAbstractListModel, a general-purpose model for list data.</p>
<p>We'll begin by discussing use of a QListView with a QStandardItemModel. The QListView is instantiated just like any other QWidget  are you getting bored with that line for every widget we encounter? It makes tiresome reading, but an easily remembered object model; one of PyQt/Pyside's greatest strengths is its simplicity, memorableness, and consistency. That aside, the QListView's constructor takes an optional parent:</p>
<p>That's enough background that we can give a simple example of the appearance of a QListView, though it won't do anything yet. We'll simplify as much as possible by making our main window a QListView; we'll do the same basic setup as any QWidget-as-a-window example:</p>
<p>Then, we'll create some QStandardItems to fill our model. As a tribute to my wife  we're expecting a third baby this summer  I'll make it a list of foods she has craved thus far. Each will have a text caption and a checkbox:</p>
